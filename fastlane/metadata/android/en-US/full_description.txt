<i>Record You</i> is a voice recorder app built with <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material Design 3 (You)</a>.

It supports multiple audio formats and codecs, such as M4A, AAC and OPUS.

<i>Record You</i> uses SAF (Storage Access Framework), thus it doesn't require any storage permissons.

It doesn't have any dependencies apart from the Android base and Material design libraries, therefore the app is very lightweight.
